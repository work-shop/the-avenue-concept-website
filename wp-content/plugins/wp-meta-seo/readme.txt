= Bulk meta edition and image resizing =

Editing meta information on an existing website can be veeeery long, open each post, edit, close it, open again and almost nobody was doing it. Especially if you need to edit content + image meta.
WP Meta SEO is going to list all posts, pages, custom post types and all images. Type your meta content and fix image size and everything is AJAX saved.
Plus, a bulk copy feature is available to save tons of time in your SEO optimization process:

* Content title to All meta titles (optional meta keywords)
* Image name to Image title
* Image name to Image alt
* Optional keyword edition

A bunch of people reduce the size of the pictures in content using handles that results to a HTML resizing. And that's something wrong for SEO, for page loading time and for image quality. 
WP Meta SEO also include this feature in the bulk edition view, you are notified and you can now optimize the size of your images in articles, click fix and it's replaced in your content (no broken links).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will the image rename bulk feature generate broken links? =
Not at all, it would have been bad for SEO :) the image name is dynamically replaced in all your content.

= If I edit image title and alt text, will that information be loaded each time my image is in a content?  =
There's an SEO option for that :) WP Meta SEO will detect that the image has missing information and once edit it, you will have a list of all the image instance and where it's loaded.
So you'll be able to define SEO info for each instance.

Nope :) All your SEO content is properly stored in the database and automatic SEO checks are also cached or run every 72 hours (unless you force the process)

= Why including meta keywords edition as it's not a SEO rank criteria? =

= Some criteria of the SEO on page analysis does not fit my content =
Yes, it may be the case when, for example, you are calling 3rd party plugins in content or using specific page layouts. You have a global option to force validation of SEO criteria.
This manual SEO validation on click on the reload analysis button.

You can also use the link: www.your-website.com/sitemap.xml after checking the option to copy the sitemap to the WordPress install root.

= Is there a real interest for SEO to display a HTML sitemap? =
